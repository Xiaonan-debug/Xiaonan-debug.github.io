I am a Year 4 undergraudte computer science student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk) (HKUST). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yufei Ding](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei), Prof. [Celine Lin](https://eiclab.scs.gatech.edu/pages/team.html), and Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/) during my undergraduate study.

My research interests are primarily in general system area. My past research experience focuses on **ML system** that includes system for **DLRM** and/or **GNN**.
