I am a first year graduate student at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) and Prof. [Yiyu Shi](https://www3.nd.edu/~scl/index.html)

<!-- My research interests are primarily in general system area. My past research experience focuses on **ML system** that includes system for **DLRM** and/or **GNN**. -->
